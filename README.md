# Pastebin-using JS 
Developed and programmed a dynamic, interactive and, user-friendly open-source web development tool based on javascript which helps in  executing programming languages such as HTML, CSS and Javascript to see how that code affects the output instantly in real-time
ABOUT THE PROJECT 
Xrello is a JavaScript, HTML and CSS playground. If you want to 
experiment, learn or help your friends with a problem, then Xrello is for you.
It is an open source web development debugging tool. 
MISSION AND VALUES 
1. Write code and have it both save in real-time, but also render a full 
preview in real-time
2. Help debug other people's JavaScript, HTML or CSS .
 Remote rendering - view the output of your Xrello on any device on any 
platform, updating in real-time.
3. Screenshot feature 
4. Download , Screenshot and share/copy code through email .
 Mission: To deliver the best debugging tool which has a Smooth running 
UI 
Values : We believe that everyone should be able to run their code and 
debug it in an easy manner 
Xrello motto is “Hack. Learn. Fix. Teach”, and Xrello is a vehicle to 
achieve all of these things, and it’s likely your use will fall in to one or more 
of these categories:
3
1. Hack — Xrello lets you experiment with the full source code in a throw-away 
environment.
2. Learn —Xrello lets you view and watch other people’s code, to see exactly 
how code affects the output instantly in real-time.
3. Fix —Xrello is perfect as a pastebin to create isolated problems to help 
diagnose and debug problems, either yourself, or by sharing the url with 
others.
4. Teach — Using tools like CodeCasting, embedding you can share your 
knowledge and help others with your experience, and by sharing that code, 
they can go on an experiment directly with your code and see real-time 
feedback in the output window.// Upcoming features
USAGE : 
There’s a few common use cases for Xrello.
The first is teaching. Teachers will use Xrello as a platform for showing how 
web languages work (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, but also languages that 
generate these, such as CoffeeScript, LESS and Markdown).
Students need only to use a browser to start creating web pages and seeing the 
direct effect of their code on the output.
The second use case is in replicating bugs. 
Developers will use Xrello to isolate and replicate bugs that demonstrates a 
particular problem..
OVERVIEW OF THE PRODUCT 
Xrello is a webapp specifically designed to help JavaScript and CSS folk test 
snippets of code, within some context, and debug the code .
Xrello allows you to edit and test JavaScript and HTML (reloading the URL 
also maintains the state of your code - new tabs doesn't). Once you're happy 
you can save, and send it to a peer for review or help.
Key benefits include: 
1. Simple and easy to use interface 
2. Online debugging tool
3. Responsive Website
4.Fast and Reliable
5.  Multifunctionality 
6. Time Saving
